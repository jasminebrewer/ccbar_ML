This repository provides an ipynb and data files necessary to use neural networks to identify jets containing a charm quark pair. At parton level (where the charm quarks are still among the final state particles), this algorithm performs with nearly 100% accuracy. At hadron level we consider two cases: (a) the charm quarks result in D mesons which are stable, or (b) the more challenging (and realistic) case where those D mesons decay to lighter hadrons which don't uniquely indicate the presence of a charm quark, and in both cases still achieve good accuracy. Data sets used for (a) are in data/nodecay, and for (b) in data/decay.

For completeness, we also provide the code to produce those data sets, using the public Monte Carlo event generator code Pythia. Generating these data sets requires an installation of pythia and fastjet, and paths to each must be specified inside compile_pythia.sh
